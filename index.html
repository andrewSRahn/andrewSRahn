			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>This web page is about two aspects of my life.  I am a software engineer and a fitness hobbyist.  I built this webpage for practical building experience with
				AWS S3 and client side skills.  As for server side skills, I do not enjoy paying AWS bills greater than $5 so please peruse my 
				<a class='paragraph-link' href='https://github.com/andrewsrahn/'> GitHub</a>.  As of October 2018, I build with various Java libraries for server side and dabble with 
				node.js a bit for client side. For my updated professional summary, including software tools and specialties, please navigate to my 
				<a class='paragraph-link' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-ahn-03a53796'> LinkedIn</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				This page contains pictures of my life and various folks I while attending various schools and working various jobs.  In order from most recent to least, I graduated 
				from California State University in Los Angeles, attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis Maryland, and graduated from Troy High School in Fullerton 
				California.  As for work, in the same order, I am a Software Development Engineer in Test at Infosys, was an SAT Instructor for CollegeSpring, and Midshipman in the 
				US Navy.  If you wish to get in touch with me my contact information is at the bottom of this page.  Please note the obfuscation in capital letters.  I am accosted by
				scammers often and genuinely, deeply, and truly LOVE robocalls.
